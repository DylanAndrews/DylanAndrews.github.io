One of the main sources of conflict during my college years was roommate related. This was never a major issue, but I certainly learned that those who are great friends are not always great roommates. In my case, the main source of conflict was dish related. I am by no means a major neat freak, but I do like the dishes to be done and to have the trash taken out. Unfortunately, one of my roommates did not care to keep the house at the same level of cleanliness(there were three of us), and after a while this started to become an issue.

After a few months of passive comments that were ineffective we decided to kindly bring it up to him and see if it could easily be resolved. I should note that I believe passive comments and passive aggressive behavior to be one of the worst forms of conlfict resolution. Anyway, we confronted him in a friendly way and told him that we would appreciate it if he could put in a little more effort when it comes to doing the dishes. He was a little defensive at first, but in the end said he would try to do a better job. He was better for a few days but then things went back to the way they were. I mentioned in a few more times, as did my other roommate, but in the end we were unable to get him to pull his weight.

I definintely think more could have been done on my part to get my roommate to pull his weight at the house, but in the end I chose not to push it because I was unwilling to put our friendship in any sort of jeopardy. I also found it to be less exhausting to just do the dished myself than to repeatedly ask him to do it. While we could have done more, I do think we went about confronting him in the right way. We were calm, kind, and understanding, but if we had been a bit more articulate about the reasons it was frustrating us he might have put in a little more effort to do what we asked. I think allowing people to see things from your perpective is absolutely essential when it comes to getting others to do what you ask, and to do so requires clarity. People are far more willing to respond to kindness than anger, and I always try to keep this in mind when dealing with others.
