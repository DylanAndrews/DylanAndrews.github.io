      Version control systems are simply systems that keep track of changes, and this is extremely important in the field of web development, where one mistake has the potential to undo hours of work. In addition to tracking changes, version control allows multiple users, by way of the merging and branching systems, to work on the same project simultaneously without the risk of accidentally deleting someone else's work.
