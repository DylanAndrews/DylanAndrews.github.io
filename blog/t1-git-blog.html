      Version control systems are simply systems that keep track of changes, and this is extremely important in the field of web development, where one mistake has the potential to undo hours of work. In addition to tracking changes, version control allows multiple users, by way of the merging and branching systems, to work on the same project simultaneously without the risk of accidentally deleting someone else's work. Here's a little rundown of how it works. If I create a branch, I have essentialy created a place where I can make changes to the project without affecting the primary version (the master branch). Once I feel good about the changes I made, which have all been tracked by Git, I can ask my teammates to review it by submitting a pull request. Once we have all agreed that my changes look good, I can go ahead and merge my branch with the master branch.

      Git, which is one of the most common version systems used in web development, is at first a bit cumbersome to manage. However, once you get the hang of it you realize that it is a  powerful platform for collaborative workflow that provides a safeguard against catastophic error.
