    <h1>My First Website</h1>
    <h2></h2>
    <h3>June 23, 2015</h3>

<p>
This is the first website I have ever made, and while I am by no means fully satisfied with it, I can certainly look at it and say that I’ve learned a lot. This learning process was by no means entirely smooth or without frustration, but it really gave me a good look into what it takes to build and maintain a website. I can honestly say that I will never look at a website the same way.
</p>
<p>
Over the past nine weeks I have come to learn that there are things about building the front end of a website that I easily grasped, and others that are still a source of frustration. What really gave me a lot of trouble was getting a handle on CSS positioning. I still feel like I have a lot to learn in this area, but I’ve definitely improved over the last few weeks. Keeping everything in order across all of my stylesheets and html documents was also fairly tricky, but I developed a good system to keep track of all the changes. My main regret during this process was having unrealistic goals in the beginning. Instead of trying to build a professional looking website with many layers of complexity, I should have just started with something simple and slowly added to it. In the end this is what I wound up doing, but only after a few painful weeks of trying to handle CSS commands that I got from the internet and that I didn’t fully understand.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall, despite many dead ends and periods of confusion, I very much enjoyed this process. It was so satisfying when I got something to work that had been eluding me for hours, and as I did it more and more I began to understand everything on a deeper level. I am looking forward to learning more and beefing up my website in the weeks to come!
