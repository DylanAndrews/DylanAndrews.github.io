    <h1>America's Embarrassing Internet Speed</h1>
    <h2></h2>

<p>
The United States is undeniably a leader in the tech world, yet its system for regulating internet service keeps its citizens from having access to affordable, high-speed internet. At the root of all of this is the arcane belief that access to communications is a luxury that should only be offered to those who can afford it. This belief, and the regulatory system that has come from it, is threatening the United States's status as a hub for innovation. Other countries, such as Sweden and South Korea, offer internet that is up to one hundred times faster than what is offerred in the U.S., and it comes at a cost of only $25. Having such widespread, quality access is an undeniable fuel for innovation, as it allows a country's citizens, both rich and poor, to innovate and discover. By limiting American's access to this sort of internet, we are keeping the necessarry tools out of the hands of the next potential Steve Jobs or Bill Gates.
</p>
<p>
  What's specifically happening in the United States is that internet service providers, of which there are very few, are allowed to have monopolies over certain areas. Because of this, they have no impetus to upgrade their service at the same rate of the rest of the modern world, and can get away with charging exorbitant prices for mediocre internet speed.
</p>
    <p>
In order to change this, high-speed internet access needs to no longer be percieved as a luxury that only the rich are entitled to. The government needs to step in and start providing access to high speed internet to all of its citizens as a basic utility.Doing so is by no means unprecedented, as it was this sort of government involvement that gave us access to highways and electricity.
