Prior to starting phase 0, I was a little unsure about the whole pairing experience. I’m very into the idea of pairing, and generally like working with people more than doing things solo, but I was a little confused about the division of labor between the navigator and driver. Now, after a few weeks of doing it, pairing is something I look forward to and benefit from in a number of ways. Regardless of whether or not I am the most knowledgeable on the topic at hand, I always seem to learn. If I’m the most knowledgable, I can solidify my own understanding by teaching my pair, and when it’s the other way around, and because all of my pairs have been patient and kind, my pair brings clarity to concepts that I’m struggling with.
</p>
<p>
While my pairing experiences have been primarily positive, there have been some things that I’ve had to get used to. I’ve always been pretty comfortable asking questions, but sometimes I need something explained multiple times before I can fully grasp it. This is obviously never a problem when I’m learning on my own, as I can read or go over something as many times as I need to without any concern for someone else, but when working with a pair it can sometimes be a little awkward to ask for something to be explained multiple times. This really hasn’t been too much of an issue since we’re all in the same boat, and since everyone, including myself, has been happy to repeat themselves as many times as needed, but I thought it was worth mentioning.

In regards to my feedback, luckily almost everything has been positive, but I have greatly appreciated the small amount of critique that I have received. I know there is room for improvement, and hearing others articulate my weak points has been very helpful. One thing that someone brought up was my workflow organization. Reading multiple tabs and keeping everything clear while pairing has been a bit of a challenge for me, and it’s definitely something I’ve been working on. Someone also said that I should be more assertive when I know something. I definitely think too much about accidentally offending someone when telling them how to do something. If my pair is more knowledgeable on a topic, I have no problem with them stepping in a fixing it, and I should definitely do the same.
