<p>
  After years as both a teacher and a student, I have come to firmly believe that one’s ability to learn is  directly linked to one’s ability and willingness to ask questions. This belief has been reinforced time and time again during my time at DBC, and I am thankful for all of my cohort members and my DBC guides for helping me along the way. While asking questions has overall led me in the right direction, there have been times where my questions were not at all helpful, and were perhaps more of a source of confusion than a step towards a solution. There are many reasons why this has can be the case, and I want to spend some time today discussing how to formulate good questions in the DBC environment.

<p>
One of the major causes of confusing questions is improper use of terminology. I have caught myself saying ternary and boolean, for example, in the wrong way, and this has derailed the conversation. For me, the best solution to this problem has been doing a bit of research prior to inquiry. This can be hard if a question arises during the middle of a conversation, but even then it can be more time efficient in the long run to take a second and make sure your question is well formulated. If I have a question to pose during office hours, I will always take a few minutes before hand to get my documents in order, and to make sure that I am using the right terminology. For example, if you have a question about how to iterate through arrays, make sure you do a little research on what arrays are so that your question makes sense. This will not only reinforce your understanding of the topic at hand, but it will allow you to absorb the answer to your question on a much deeper level.
