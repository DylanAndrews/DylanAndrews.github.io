    <p>
    Throughout this week the difference between <strong>inline</strong> and <strong>inline-block</strong> has eluded me. I've decided to do further research for this blog post in an effort to educate myself and anyone else who is struggling with these concepts.
</p>
<p>
    The first thing that's important to understand is that inline, inline-block, block, and none are the four possible values for display, which is a positioning property. Think of display as a subset of positioning, and these four values as subsets of display.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before getting into inline-block we should talk about block and inline separately.<p> <strong>Block</strong> makes an element a block box that accepts width and height settings, it but doesn't allow anything to sit next to it. The block property makes the element take up the full width of the page.
    </p>
      <p><strong>Inline</strong> is in many resplects the opposite of block. It allows other elements to sit next to one-another, but it doesn't allow the element to have a set height or width.
      </p>
      <p>
        With <strong>inline-block</strong>, which is kind of like a specification of block, we are allowing other elements to sit next to our block on the same line. The block part of inline-block has allowed the element to have height and width, and the inline part of the inline-block has allowed other elements to sit next to it on the same line. This can be very helpful when it comes to creating navigation bars like the one at the top right of this page.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope this helps. I can certainly say that doing the research and articulating the concepts has helped improve my understanding. Please feel free to get in touch if you are still confused or if something I wrote is wrong. Thanks!
