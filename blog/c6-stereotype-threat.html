    <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>

It is truly amazing how much the expectation of failure, which is often  caused by the stereotype threat, dictates its certainty, and the same can be said of success.  For the past four years I have been teaching and performing music full time, and during that time I have seen the effects of stereo-type threat in myself, my students, and my fellow musicians. No one is totally free from the effects of stereotypes, but by acknowledging these threats we can limit their impact.
</p>
<p>

For myself, the stereotype threat arose when I was considering different career paths, specifically being a teacher. In our society certain teaching positions are considered more appropriate for men than for women. These stereotypes are not only offensive, but damaging to both men and women. For example, if a man decides to teach elementary school he is often times viewed as settling for something below his ability, but if a woman makes that same decision she is viewed as a compassionate person who is acting on her maternal instincts. I will admit that these are a bit extreme and that many people no longer feel this way, but not long ago they were unanimously believed, and today are undeniably prevalent on some level. Because I was more interested in teaching high school I was not very affected by this stereotype, but it did cross my mind and perhaps made me view my aspirations of teaching in a way that I wouldn’t have if these stereotypes didn’t exist.

When it comes to other people, I have seen many of my female students succumb to these threats, but have also seen many overcome them. The drums, which is what I teach, are for some reason a male dominated instrument, and this often times leads women to think that they will never succeed on the instrument. Because of this, less women take up the drums at a young age, and if they do are more likely to quit because they think it’s a futile effort. Luckily, I have had many female students who have put these nonsensical stereotypes aside and have gone on to be great drummers. I applaud them for doing this, and I think that we should all try as hard as we can to ignore the stereotypes that society applies to our demographic.
