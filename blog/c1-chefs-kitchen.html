      I think the DBC learning/teaching philosophy is simply incredible. The curriculum design, specifically the way that each cohort progresses most effectively as a single unit, is something that I have never experienced in education, and I am already starting to feel it’s positive effects. Ultimately, I’m looking forward to being thrown into the deep end and having to admit my own ignorance. I know there may be times when I feel vulnerable and lost, but I know that these will be valuable learning experiences.
