Last week’s blog was all about the stereotype threat, and for this week I'm going to switch gears a bit and talk about values. The following list outlines what I hold to be most important when it comes to leading a quality life. I’ve always found that when these things are in line in my life, my life is at its best.

<p>-Family</p>
<p>-Ambition</p>
<p>-Compassion</p>
<p>-Creativity</p>
<p>-Friendships</p>
<p>-Meaningful work</p>

<p>-Pleasure without conscience</p>
<p>-Knowledge without character</p>
<p>-Commerce without morality</p>
<p>-Science without humanity</p>
<p>-Politics without principle</p>
<p>
In terms of advice, I would say that I am an active seeker and giver of advice. If I am ever having any issue, whether it’s big or small, I will almost always ask for advice from people I am close to. The last thing I gave someone advice about was about their schooling/career, and after the conversation he was definitely glad to have talked through it. I often find that just having someone who will listen is all you need, and that by vocalizing your concern you can work through it yourself. Just having someone who cares and who can support you is a big part of
