    <h1>The handy enumerable group_by</h1>
    <h2></h2>

<p>
The enumerable method group_by can be run on any enumerable and will always output a hash. The method will take a block and run that for every object in the enumerable. The resulting hash's keys will be the results from running the code block, and the values will be arrays of the objects in the enumerable that corresponded to that key.
<br></br>
Here's an example.
</p>
<code>
  (1..14).group_by { |i| i%4 }
  <br></br>
{1=>[1, 5, 9, 13], 2=>[2, 6, 10, 14], 3=>[3, 7, 11], 0=>[4, 8, 12]}
  </code>
<p>
Lets unpack this a bit, because the last paragraph is by no means easy reading. Running %4 on any integer will give you the remainder of that number after dividing it by 4. For example, the remainder of 14/4 is 2, so 14 % 4 = 2. When the block ran itself on every integer from 1 to 14 it made all of the resulting remainders keys in the hash. As you can see, 2 is a key in the hash, and that's because 2 % 4, 6 % 4, 10 % 4, and 14 % 4 all equal 2. Furthermore, 2, 6, 10, and 14 are the values (placed in an array) that corresponds to the key 2.
    </p>

I hope that helps. Before checking out, take a look at how group_by can by run on strings.
</p>
  <code>
colors =  ["red", "orange", "yellow", "blue","green", "black"]
p colors.group_by {|color| color.size }
}<br></br>
{3=>["red"], 6=>["orange", "yellow"], 4=>["blue"], 5=>["green", "black"]}
 </code>

  See if you can make sense of it!
