As the title suggests, I am primarily a concrete sequential thinker. However, every time I take this test I seem to get a different answer, and after graphing my answers this makes sense. I fall very close to the middle of the spectrum. In some situations I rely on order, structure, and logic, and in others I am quite comfortable with flexibility, takings risks, and abstraction. However, when it comes to the world of DBC, and learning in general, I definitely see myself as a concrete sequential thinker.

Given that I am a concrete sequential thinker, it is best that I adopt strategies that best fit my thinking style. For example, each week in Phase 0 we are presented with a defined set of challenges, and something that has really helped me is going back through all of them at the end of the week to make sure there are no weak points. Taking the time to review and go over my work really helps me feel like I'm on track, and helps ensure that I don't fall behind. I have also developed a strict work routine that fits well with my schedule, and this has made getting my work done less of a challenge. The other thing that has been great for me is attending the office hours. I attend at least two sessions a week, and this has always been a huge help. Having experts at my disposal has been crucial for my progress and understanding, and I'm looking forward to the onsite portion, where these experts will be even closer.

While I am ultimately happy with how DBC has been going, there are certianly some areas with room for improvement. One thing that I need to work on is going back over the reading material after doing the challenges. While I definitely feel like I learn from the reading, it is harder for me to get a lot out of it without having first implemented the concepts the books are addressing. The books allow a depth of understanding that is very valuable, and I think if I re-read the chapters after doing the exercises I will get more out of the reading. Something else I struggle with is being comfortable with the potential for multiple correct answers. I think this is really cool, but it makes me a little uneasy when it comes to knowing whether or not I have mastered something. I need to be more adventurous with trying different things and being ok with the fact that there are many correct means to an end.
